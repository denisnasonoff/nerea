							<p>We are experienced in integrating Microsoft Dynamics CRM with diverse existing internal systems of your organization.</p>

							<div class="block-title smaller">Integration with ERP</div>
							<p>
								CRM users can create quotes and orders and, when the prospect is ready to buy, 
								they can create the account in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, for example for accounting purposes, 
								and push the order into the system with just a few keystrokes. If the order, invoice and payment information from the ERP system is brought back into CRM, 
								users will be able to see the status of a sale. Workflows can be set up to alert CRM users to follow up on invoices, and reports can be run from inside of 
								CRM that combine CRM data and ERP data into one report.

							<div class="block-title smaller">Integration with Outlook</div>
							<p>
								Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a full integration with Outlook for the seamless tracking of activities such as emails, 
								appointments or tasks. Emails can be automatically linked to all senders and recipients' records, as well as related CRM entities such as contracts or invoices. 
								They can also be directly converted into sales opportunities or service cases.

							<div class="block-title smaller">Microsoft Office 365</div>
							<p>Integration between Microsoft Dynamics CRM and the cloud-based version of Microsoft office equips your people with collaborative tools that are easy to use, easy to access, 
								and work well together, driving their productivity. CRM Online (the hosted version of CRM) and Office 365 pair together to unlock this power of productivity. 
								The results are enriched customer relationships, streamlined business processes, and improved communication and collaboration across the enterprise.
